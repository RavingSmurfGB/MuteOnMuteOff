In this example code, we mute the microphone "Scarlett Solo USB".
However to find your microphone, simply load up Sound control panel and enter what the micrphone's name is that you want to control..

It stores whether the micprhone is muted in a text file, with 1 being muted on 0 being not muted.

This program also uses a image pop up which will show whether your device is muted or not.

Please read the requirements and install what is needed.
